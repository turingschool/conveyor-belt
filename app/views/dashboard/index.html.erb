        Let's give your project a name:
        <%= f.text_field :name, class: "block col-12 field" %>
        <em>e.g. BE3 - Brownfield</em><br>
        <em>This is used to find the project later and will not impact anything on GitHub.</em>
      </p>
      <h4>Step 2.</h4>
      <p>
        Paste in the link of the project board you'd like to clone:
        <%= f.text_field :project_board_base_url, class: "block col-12 field" %>
        <em>e.g. https://github.com/turingschool/your-repo/projects/1</em><br>
        <em>Notice this is a link to a project and not a repo.</em>
      </p>
      <%= f.submit 'Create', class: "mt2 btn btn-primary mb1" %>
    <% end %>

  <p>Hi <%= current_user.nickname %>!</p>
  <p>We've been expecting you. There's not much to do here unless a Turing School staff member sends you a special link. If you've already received a link from a staff member, try visiting it again. Otherwise, sit tight. You should receive something shortly.</p>
  <p>Your Pal,<br>HAL 9000</p>
